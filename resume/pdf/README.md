# Resume PDFs

This directory contains the generated PDF versions of the resumes.

## Files

- **`resume.en.pdf`** - English version of the resume
- **`resume.fr.pdf`** - French version of the resume

## Generation

PDFs are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

The workflow uses `resume-cli` with the `elegant` theme to generate professional-looking PDFs from the JSON Resume files.

## Manual Generation

To generate PDFs manually, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install resume-cli and theme
npm install -g resume-cli
npm install -g jsonresume-theme-elegant

# Generate English PDF
resume export resume/pdf/resume.en.pdf --resume resume/resume.en.json --format pdf --theme elegant

# Generate French PDF
resume export resume/pdf/resume.fr.pdf --resume resume/resume.fr.json --format pdf --theme elegant
```

## Preview on Pull Requests

When a pull request is created that modifies the resume files, the workflow generates preview PDFs and uploads them as artifacts. You can download them from the workflow run page to review the changes before merging.
