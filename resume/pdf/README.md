# Resume PDFs

This directory contains the generated PDF versions of the resumes.

## Files

- **`resume.en.pdf`** - English version of the resume
- **`resume.fr.pdf`** - French version of the resume

## Generation

PDFs are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

The workflow uses a **custom ESCEMI theme** specifically designed for senior technical profiles following CV Coach best practices.

## Theme Features

The custom `jsonresume-theme-escemi` provides:

- **Two-column layout**: Contact information and skills on the left, professional experience on the right
- **ESCEMI branding**: Source Sans Pro typography with official ESCEMI colors (dark blue #1c3144, gold #ecb807)
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear distinction between sections with icons and proper spacing
- **ATS optimization**: Simple, parser-friendly structure without tables or complex layouts
- **Metric emphasis**: Highlights quantifiable achievements and business impact
- **Print optimization**: A4 format with proper page breaks and margins

See [../themes/escemi/README.md](../themes/escemi/README.md) for complete theme documentation.

## Manual Generation

To generate PDFs manually:

```bash
# From the repository root, navigate to the actions directory
cd .github/actions/generate-resume-pdf

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Generate English PDF
npm run generate-pdf -- ../../resume/resume.en.json ../../resume/pdf/resume.en.pdf

# Generate French PDF
npm run generate-pdf -- ../../resume/resume.fr.json ../../resume/pdf/resume.fr.pdf
```

## Preview on Pull Requests

When a pull request is created that modifies the resume files, the workflow generates preview PDFs and uploads them as artifacts. You can download them from the workflow run page to review the changes before merging.
